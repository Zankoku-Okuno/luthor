FIXME
=====
can't lex a dedent, esp. due to trying to detect dedents at the end of input
	either write my own manyAccum, or send in an issue
documentation links to Parsec aren't resolving on hackage

I noticed lots of typos in docs



TODO
====
regex to parser

TEST
====
nextline + dedent
Lex module

make sure anything re-exported from Parsec actually works, even when passed a parser of the form (p1 *> p2), and p1 succeeds but p2 fails

CLEANUP
=======
common lexers
	common programming idioms
		heredocs
		sci notation allowing 0. and .0
		blankline helper
		check that there's nothing more I can do about whitespace
		? triple-quoted strings
		names for bsnl and bsnlwsbs
		html-style entities
		make sure block/nesting comments fail if unclosed
		? use CI type constructor
