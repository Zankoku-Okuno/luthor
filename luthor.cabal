description:         Like parser combinators? Building a big parser? Save hundreds of
                     sloc, hours of debuging and several headaches by using Luthor
                     on top of the familiar Parsec library.
                     .
                     Parsec works great for small parsers, but as the size of the
                     parser grows, complexity can grow exponentially without taking
                     serious and tricky precautions. Luthor provides reusable
                     utilities to isolate the complex parts of parsing.
                     Amonst its weaponry are 1) more composable combinators,
                     2) pre-built token parsers, 3) tools to build a scannerful parser,
                     and 4) tools to work with indentation.
                     Luthor reduces overall complexity, generally increases performance
                     and error reporting, and cuts down on wheel re-invention.
                     .
                     BIG CAVEAT: It is difficult to understand all the ways in which 
                     Parsec fails to be composable, so there may be some combinators
                     in Luthor which fail to be composable. If you're getting weird
                     (i.e. Parsec-like) results, add a @try@ and please report.
