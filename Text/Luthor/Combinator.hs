{-| Parsec combinators are not composable by default. The idea is that this increases efficiency
    by eliminating unnecessary backtracking. The practical problem with this approach is that it
    is difficult to determine exactly where backtracking really is necessary and insert the needed
    'try' combinators. Any mistakes are almost always subtle and difficult to diagnose and fix.

    Compute power is cheap and programmers are expensive, so it only makes sense to make it easy on
    the programmer first and on the computer second. This module is mostly full of composable drop-in
    replacements for Parsec combinators. There's also some renaming, to make the API more idiomatic.
    Also, some additional combinators are exported.

    When migrating to this API, it is recommended to import Parsec modules qualified so that
    your code will be composable by default. Where efficiency really is needed, you can /carefully/
    but easily fall back to non-composable Parsec combinators by namespacing the appropriate
    combinators.
    
    One place where we could not provide a replacement was the '<|>' operator. This is exported by
    the 'Alternative' typeclass, which we really don't want to mess with. The composable alternative
    is spelled '<||>'.

    The re-named parsers are 'option', 'optional', 'optional_', 'many_', and 'many1_'. It may not
    be easiest to switch old habits, but these names are more idiomatic and also reduce the
    amount of typing necessary. Also, we've altered the semantics of 'manyTill' to make room for the
    new 'manyThru' combinator. This gives the user an easy choice whether to consume the terminating
    element. Finally, we've changed the type of 'notFollowedBy' to allow writing
    @x \`notfollowedBy\` y@ in place of @x <* notFollowedBy y@.

    Below are some selected examples where this library is more intuitive:

    * In Parsec, @string \"aaa\" \<|\> string \"aa\"@, will fail on input @\"aa\"@.
        Using this module's '<||>' will succeed.

    * In Parsec, @char 'a' \`sepBy\` char ' ' *> optional (char ' ') *> eof@ will fail on input
        @\"a a \"@. Using this module's 'sepBy' will succeed. Similar results hold for 'sepBy1',
        'chainl', 'chainl1', 'chainr', and 'chainr1'.

    * In Parsec, @lookAhead (many1 digit) *> many1 digit@ will fail on input such as @\"123\"@.
        Similarly, @notFollowedBy (string \"letter\") *> string \"let\"@ will fail on @\"let\"@.
        Using this module's 'lookAhead' or 'notFollowedBy' will succeed in the respective cases.

    * In Parsec, @anyChar \`manyTill\` string \"-->\" *> eof@ will fail on input
        @\"part1 -- part2-->\"@. Using this module's 'manyThru' will succeed with the same semantics.
        This modules 'manyTill' will not consume the @\"-->\"@.
    
    While we're at it, we've also re-exported applicative parsing functions and defined some of our
    own combinators that have been found useful. Applicative parsing is recommended over monadic
    parsing where it will suffice, so we'd rather eliminate the extra @Control.Applicative@ import.
    Among the additional combinators defined here are 'dispatch', 'count', 'atLeast', 'atMost', 'manyNM',
    'chomp', and 'between2'.
